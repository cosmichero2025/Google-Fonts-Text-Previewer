# Text Previewer

A simple little web app I built because I wasn't that confident in my AJAX/JSON skills so I used this to learn some more. All it really does is take user input from a web font then changes the basic template to that web font's font family. It also displays the top 6 "trending" fonts on the google fonts platform.
